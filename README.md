# Editor Configuration

## Sublime
Ah Sublime. Life would not be the same without you. I wouldn't know
what to do if multi-edit did not exist. Coding is just not the same.

## Vim
Vim is my second favorite editor that I like to use to edit configuration
files and take notes in everyday life. I love vim's navigation features.
