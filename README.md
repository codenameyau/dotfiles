# dotfiles

A collection of my dotfiles. I run Linux at home and OSX at work and use
[zsh with Pretzo](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) for my shell.
I use Sublime as my primary text editor and use vim for quick edits and notetaking.

## Vim Plugins
- [molokai color scheme](https://github.com/tomasr/molokai)
- [ctrP fuzzy search](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim)
